# Qubit_visualization
Interactive Input Panel – enter complex amplitudes 𝑎,𝑏 directly.
Interactive Canvas – click to set amplitudes dynamically.
Cartesian Plane Plot – visualize amplitudes of ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩.
Bloch Sphere View – simplified & Wikipedia-style with θ/φ arcs.
Normalized State Display – always shows properly normalized qubit.
