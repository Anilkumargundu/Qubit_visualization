In quantum computing, we begin with a single basis state and apply the Hadamard gate to create a superposition in which all possible states are equally probable.
This superposed state is then processed by additional quantum gates, allowing computations to act on all basis states simultaneously — which is the key difference from classical computing. 
However, once we perform a measurement, the superposition collapses, and we observe only one of the possible basis states according to their probability amplitudes.
This is the central idea: the computation is effectively carried out over all combinations at once due to the superposition principle.
